# t9Hack-FernandezKuzinski
Thank you for the help T9 Hackathon and Brady Kuzinski for the advice and helping guide me to a product within 24 hours!

This is a product in which is meant to assist students of any kind in finding individuals that have shared interests as themselves. This is similar to facebook such that you can find communities of people by searching for specifics such as majors, activities, and or classes and recieving results of students who fit such descriptions. You are able to add profiles, classes, and clubs/ activities to the program to add new ones as needed. This idea was meant to be made into a website, however, with the time restrictions it was simply a prototype of what this idea could be. The purpose of this project was to help other students, espectially after Covid, find groups of people that they can connect with that have these similarities or shared interests, it is meant to bring people together.

Note: When the program is executed, it adds students from a premade list to the program such that it is not empty when you begin searching. This means that not everything that is expected to be searched for, such as all majors, is in the list hence after pressing print all, you should be aware of what can be searched for. This can also be added to and built off of but ensure that it stayes in the same format as is in the .csv files.
